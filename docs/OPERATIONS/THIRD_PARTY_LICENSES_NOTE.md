# Third-Party Licenses Note

Third-party dependency licenses are managed via npm metadata and lockfiles.

Current baseline:
- Dependency license inventory source: `package-lock.json` + installed package manifests.
- Release process expectation: generate `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` for distribution artifacts.

Out of scope for this ticket:
- Full notice bundle generation and packaging automation.

Follow-up ticket:
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES_GENERATION_v1.0`

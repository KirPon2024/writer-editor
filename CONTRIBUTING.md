## Issues

- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or request features.
- Keep issues focused and include clear reproduction steps when applicable.

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Follow the project canon and process docs: `CANON.md` and `docs/PROCESS.md`.
- Do not mix runtime changes with docs/CI changes in a single PR (see `CANON.md`).
- Avoid dependency changes unless explicitly requested.
